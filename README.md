# luciphor\_dtaselect\_integratorProgram that integrates results from Luciphor (PTM localization scoring algorithm) into DTASelect output files.Input:  - luciphor output  - dtaselect output- localLFR threshold (optional)- globalLFR threshold (optional) Output:- It overrides the sequences of the PSMs on the DTASelect file that pass the thresholds (if available) on the luciphor output. - It also adds 3 new columns (‘original_sequence’, ‘globalFLR’ and ‘localFLR’) for ONLY the PSMs that pass the luciphor score thresholds AND that change any PTM localization with respect to the original PSM sequence. - The original DTASelect file is backed up to a new file adding “_original” to the end of its name.
